# Ethereum-Smart-Contract

Using Ethereum, Truffle, Gananche, and Metamask I created a private blockchain to create a todoList. The data for the todolist is stored within a blockchain. The todoList smart contract is deployed on the blockchain to create the logic of the application. Then using HTML, CSS, and Javascript the client-side was created.
